### What I learned

i wrote code after a while and main problem for me was i usually use bootstrap to make we bpages or website responsive. but this time i wanted to do it without using bootstrap even though i had no proir knowledge of Medai queries but now i got to know it a little. 


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
 body{
    margin: 0px;
    padding: 0px;
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    max-width: 1440px;
    min-width: 375px;
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}
}
```


### Continued development

I want to focus more on styling using media queries as i have enought knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3 too. but now i'll try to use it often and to make  my code more efficient. 
I would like to continue learning more about responsive design and how to make websites look good on all devices.
